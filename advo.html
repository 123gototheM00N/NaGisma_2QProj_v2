            <h2>What is climate change and why is it important to know?</h2>
            <p>According to the United Nations' reference, climate change refers to long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns. Such changes are otherwise natural; human activities have been the dominant cause since the 1800s. This is mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels-coal, oil, and gas-which releases the emission of greenhouse gases, serving as a blanket that wraps up the earth and traps heat from the sun, thereby raising the temperature. Climate scientists have concluded that humans are the cause of nearly all global heating over the past 200 years, making the surface of the Earth about 1.42°C warmer compared to the temperature before the Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p>Understanding climate change is important because its impacts reach far beyond just warmer temperatures; it can affect nearly anything that involves a connected system, which puts human well-being in danger. This includes intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, catastrophic storms, and declining biodiversity. These consequences directly affect human health, the ability to grow food, housing, safety, and even work, often posing the greatest risks for the most vulnerable populations.</p>
            <p>Knowledge is important because it enlightens on the urgent need for action. The UN emphasizes that curtailing the rise in global temperatures to no more than 1.5°C is required to avoid the worst impacts and maintain a liveable climate. It requires three broad categories of action, including: cutting emissions by switching energy systems to renewables, drastically reducing fossil fuel use; adaptation to current and future climate impacts to protect people and infrastructure; and securing the necessary financial investments to make these adjustments globally.</p>

            <h2>Why Is the topic Greenhouse Gases?</h2>
            <p>The subject of greenhouse gases is critically important because, through their increase in the atmosphere, they are considered the main cause of climate change and global warming. For the past 150 years, human activities associated with the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have substantially raised the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a rising climate that requires immediate action to avoid severe environmental and societal consequences.</p>
            <p>The focus on greenhouse gases is because of the need for climate mitigation-that is, to stop the increase in the amount of these gases. It requires two tasks: not adding more gas into the air and increasing the Earth's capacity to pull them out. Solutions include transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy like solar and wind, reducing dependence on transportation with gasoline-powered technologies, decreasing electricity consumption, and reducing emissions from industry and agriculture.</p>
            <p>Addressing greenhouse gases is key because climate mitigation will require concerted action at the individual, community, and national levels. In fact, through the alteration of personal habits-like using less energy or eating a more plant-rich diet-to large-scale changes like switching power plants to renewables-humanity can stop the increasing concentration of those heat-trapping gases and prevent further climate warming.</p>

            <h2>How impactful is it in the Philippines?</h2>
            <p>While the Philippines is an insignificant emitter of GHGs, ranking very low at 0.48% in the global share of GHG emissions, it is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, ranking 121st according to ND-GAIN on the Climate Vulnerability Index, due to extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other hazards. This makes it an imperative of national security and survival to reduce global GHGs.</p>
            <p>In consideration of this high exposure, the Philippines presented its first NDC in 2021, reflecting a commitment both to mitigation and adaptation. On the subject of mitigation, the country is committed to a projected GHG emissions reduction and avoidance of 75% for the period 2020–2030, of which 2.71% is unconditional. The commitment pertains to the five sectors of agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy. The forestry sector is explicitly excluded from this commitment because the Philippines claims that the sector works as a net sink, where forests absorb more carbon than they emit.</p>
            <p>Beyond emission reductions, the Philippines focuses on adaptation and resiliency in key sectors as a means of preparing for, minimizing, and responding to loss and damage from climate change. These range from biodiversity, health, food security, forestry, water resources, and human security. The national strategy posits that effective action on greenhouse gases must be accompanied by equitable adaptation strategies that also yield mitigation co-benefits, charting a climate-resilient trajectory for the nation.</p>
